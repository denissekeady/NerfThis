## ⏳ About This Project
Hi there! This website was my entry point into the world of Laravel, so while it may not use the full power of the framework, it still packs a punch with some cool features. This Overwatch-themed website is all about sharing advice and seeking help to enhance your gameplay and level up your skills!
With two types of posts, players can share **Advice** or request **Assistance**, specifying the gaming platform, role, and hero.

### 🛡️ **Preventing Fake Reviews**
To keep things honest, we've implemented measures to detect and stop fake reviews:  
1. If the last five reviews are for the same user.  
2. If 75% of a user’s reviews come from the same gamer (checked after 10 reviews).  
3. If a gamer receives 20 reviews rated four or five stars in under a minute.  

**Actions Taken:**  
- For behaviors 1 and 2, the user is **banned from commenting**, and their reviews are removed.  
- For behavior 3, all the gamer’s posts will have **locked comments** to prevent further misuse.  

Don't worry, you can still browse the website even if you're banned from commenting!
